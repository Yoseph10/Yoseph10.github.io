title: Multidimensional Wellbeing in Peru
summary: This repository provides the codes I created for my bachelor thesis called Assessing multidimensional well-being in Peru, An empirical operationalization of the capabilities approach through the estimation of Multiple Indicator and Multiple Cause Models . I used Survey on Multidimensional Wellbeing. This dataset was provided by Instituto de Desarrollo Humano de America Latina (IDHAL-PUCP).

This study evaluates the multidimensional well-being of people over 18 years of age
in Peru through an empirical operationalization of the capabilities approach
by Amartya Sen. Specifically, this study makes use of models of Multiple
Indicators and Multiple Causes (MIMIC), which recognize the nature of the
as latent capabilities variables, to estimate a set of five capabilities:
“Sociability”, “Agency/Empowerment”, “Citizenship”, “Safety” and “Health”. The
data used come from the Survey on Multidimensional Well-being carried out
carried out in 2018 by the Institute of Public Opinion (IOP-PUCP) and the Institute of
Human Development of Latin America (IDHAL-PUCP). The main results
show that men are better off than women in
all the skills and abilities that people living in urban areas have
in a better situation than those who live in rural areas in all of them except
of the “Security” capacity. In line with the above, the results of the analysis
sample set that men abilities are in a better
situation than women in terms of multidimensional well-being and that women
people who live in urban areas are better in well-being
multidimensional than those who live in rural areas. If we do not include “Security” in
the joint analysis of capacities, the urban-rural gap in well-being
increases multidimensional.
